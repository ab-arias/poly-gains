Style Checker: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)  
To install prettier modules, run "npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier" in the frontend and backend folders.  
Prior to pushing code to the repo, make sure to run "npm run style" in the both subdirectories.  
Also, run "npm test" in each subdirectory to check if files adhere to prettier formatting.
